   The overall idea of working with firebase is that there are references (to databases) and observers on those references
   
   - Reference: Essentially points to the URL of your database; this can be the root, or any of its child nodes
   - Observing: An observer well, observes changes to a database. Which changes that are observed are determined when you
                Instantiate an observer

   If you're unsure, just dump() a FIRDatabaseReference to know what the URL youre working with; it will always begin like:
   
                                      https://{unique-db-id}.firebase.com/
   
   
   "Building" on an existing reference just means that you're adding addtion path components to the base URL. So having
   something like: 
   
                  let rootDatabaseReference: FIRDatabaseReference = FIRDatabase.database().reference()
                  // evaluates to --> https://{unique-db-id}.firebase.com/
   
                  let topLevelDatabaseReference: FIRDatabaseReference = rootDatabaseReference.child("users")
                  // evaluates to --> https://{unique-db-id}.firebase.com/users
   
                  let specificUserReference: FIRDatabaseReference = topLevelDatabaseReference.child("4231235") // pretend this is a userID
                  // evaluates to --> https://{unique-db-id}.firebase.com/users/4231235
   
   
   Adding observers allows you to run a closure when a specific event happens to the database reference you're currently observing. 
   Something like:
   
                  rootDatabaseReference.observe(.childAdded, with: { (snapshot: FIRDataSnapshot) in
                    // code can be added here to do stuff
                  })
   
   In the above example, we create an observer that "listens/observes" a .childAdded event (which is caused by adding a new child
   node to that point in the database). 
   
   
   Now, what is a FIRDataSnapshot? It's a "snapshot" of your database at that node at that present moment in time (think like
   literally a photo snapshot, on like a piece of photo paper... film? whatever.) The FIRDataSnapshot has a number of properties
   to inspect the database at that point, I encourage you to look at the documentation for full details:
   
   https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/ios/firebasedatabase/api/reference/Classes/FIRDataSnapshot

  let databaseReference = FIRDatabase.database().reference().child("shoppingCartItems")
  var databaseObserver: FIRDatabaseHandle?
  var signInUser: FIRUser?
  
  
  // this was an early decision in trying to store the keys for the shoppingCartItems in our database we wanted to remove
  // we quickly moved away from this though when we realized that we could just work with the FIRDataSnapshot directly
  var keysToRemove: [String] = [] {
    didSet {
      dump(keysToRemove) // this dump was done to observe the effects of our code, in that we were interested in seeing the contents of this array
    }

  func queryForOutdatedRecords() {
    // "outdated" refers to missing the key "addedBy"
    
    // first we add an observer on databaseReference which will look for changes at this particular node
    // but also, it will fire when the app runs in order to return all of the children at that node
    let _ = databaseReference.observe(.childAdded, with: { (snapshot) in
      
      // Q: How did I know to go through the snapshot's children?
      // A: print() statements, lots of them. I'm not familiar with firebase so I take the process one step at a time.
      //    - I printed out to console first snapshot to see what it looked like
      //    - At that point i just typed out snapshot. and checked out what the autofill gave me
      //    - I went through a few that seemed relevant, ultimately picking snapshot.children since I know i need to look through
      //      all of the nodes in my database
      //    - When i saw snapshot.children could be enumerated over, i added the for-in loop.
      //    - In that loop I printed out each child object.
      //    - That printing showed me that the child object was of type FIRDataSnapshot, so at that point i did the force 
      //      typecase as! [FIRDataSnapshot]
      //    - From that point, i checked the properties that I could access on each child
      //    - I noticed that the structure at that point resembled json/dictionary so I attempted to typecase to [String : Anyobject]
      //    - When I saw that worked, I specifically checked for known keys, like value["price"] to see if I got a return 
      //      value
      //    - When that worked, I checked specifically for "addedBy" key
      // 
      //    And that's the story of development
