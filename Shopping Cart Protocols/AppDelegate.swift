    let glasses = ShoppingCartItem(price: 53.70, name: "Sabrina's Glasses", sku: 90000000091, quantity: 1)
    
    let shoppingSession = ShoppingSession.shared
    
    // Q: Why are both these lines duplicated? 
    // A: It was to illustrate that the == operator is called when attempting to access a dictionary where a ShoppingCartItem is used as a key
    //    shoppingSession.shoppingCart.addToCart(item: glasses, quantity: 1)
    //    shoppingSession.shoppingCart.addToCart(item: glasses, quantity: 1)
    
    // Q: Why is this line here to create another ShoppingCartItem?
    // A: Further down we try out the Equatable protocol by comparing these two instances of ShoppingCartItem
    let otherGlasses = ShoppingCartItem(price: 53.70, name: "Louis's Glasses", sku: 9000000023, quantity: 1)
    
    // Q: The hell is this infix operator?
    // A: Take a look at ShoppingCartItem.swift for the declarations for the operators (or run the project and see what this does)
    (glasses *^ otherGlasses) // the "winking meow" infix operator
    glasses^*^ // the "meow" postfix operator >^*^<
    
    if glasses != otherGlasses {
      print("Glasses are not the same")

    //    print("Found: \(shoppingSession.shoppingCart.quantityForItem(item: otherGlasses))")
    
    
    // ----- Overloaded Operators ------ //
    // The below constants were just to illustrate there are type-specific versions of the * operator
    // See https://developer.apple.com/reference/swift/swift_standard_library_operators for full list
    let thirtyTwoIntA: Int32 = 20
    let thirtyTwoIntB: Int32 = 20
    
    let sixtyFourIntA: Int64 = 25
    let sixtyFourIntB: Int64 = 25
    
    //    print(thirtyTwoIntA * thirtyTwoIntB)
    //    print(sixtyFourIntA * sixtyFourIntB)
    
    let a: CGFloat = 6.0
    let b: Float = 7.0
    let c: Double = 8.0
    
    c^*^
    // The commented line below wont work because there is no operator function that offers multiplying a Float and CGFloat
    //    print(a * b)
    
    // This is a custom operator example to just show something a little more practical application of custom operators. 
    // In this case it takes two floats and returns a CGPoint
    let newPoint = 3.0 >< 4.0
    
    // If you look at the function definition for + operator, you'll notice that (one of) the implementation has a function
    // type (String, String) -> String which is a valid closure to use in the .reduce funciton
    let fullString = ["these", "are", "strings"].reduce("", +)
    
    
    
    // ----- Function Types ------ //
    // Below is just an example of passing a closure as a parameter
    // The overall idea to reinforce was that closures have "types"
    
    //    func +(lhs: String, rhs: String) -> String
    //    (String, String) -> String
    let stringClosure = { (a: String, b: String) in
      return a + b
